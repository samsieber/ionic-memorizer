# ionic-memorizer
This is a simple app written using Ionic/Angular/Cordova for Android (and possible iOS)


## How to use
You can put in a text and give it a title. The app then saves it.
You can select a text to memorize (if you've entered it). 
The memorization screen has a slider that changes how much of the text is visible. 
It does so by replacing words with the letter that they start with.

See the marketing/screenshots to see examples.

## Technologies used
Memorizer is written in javascript using the Ionic/Angular/Cordova stack. 

In addition to the stock stack, I use angular-moment/moment.js for rendering and manipulating dates; 
I use elastic.js for an autoexpanding text area.

Right now, the texts are stored in the built in local-storage. That may change over time.
